# Multi-arch Veloren Docker images

The purpose of this repository is to run automated builds that generate multi-architecture Docker images for the Veloren CLI server, as the official image builds do not supply `aarch64` images.

Additionally, the nighly image builds are published with date-stamped tags to make it easier to identify which version of the server they actually contain.
